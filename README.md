## Tensorflow Object Detection API
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.

## YOLO: Realtime Object Detection
You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. On a Titan X it processes images at 40-90 FPS and has a mAP on VOC 2007 of 78.6% and a mAP of 48.1% on COCO test-dev.

## SSD
SSD is an unified framework for object detection with a single network. It has been originally introduced in this research [pdf](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).
